Hello! Here are some basic instructions to fill in spaces that the game can't do itself in its current form.

The goal of the game is to progress from planet to planet, collecting fuel cans on each location.

The game has a graphical view and a text-only view. You can press tab to switch between them.

You interact with the game by giving commands to a character in the crew, making them perform various actions.
Currently available commands are:
- take <item>
- take all
- give <character> <item>
- wield <item>
- use <item>
- enter <path/door>
- force <door>
- attack <creature>
- attack
- wait
- rest
- launch ship
- status
- control <character>
- trade
- recruit aftik
When trading at a store, there are the following commands:
- buy <item>
- buy <number> <items>
- sell <item>
- sell <number> <items>
- sell all <items>
- exit
- status

Notes:
- "rest" doesn't heal health, instead it waits until stamina (a poorly visible stat that helps with dodging attacks) has recovered for the controlled character.
- Interactions with the store does not yet have accompanying graphics to show what's for sale. You'll have to switch over to text-only for this one for now.
