Hello! Here are some basic instructions to fill in spaces that the game can't do itself in its current form.

The goal of the game is to progress from planet to planet, collecting fuel cans on each location.

The game has a graphical view and a text-only view. You can press tab to switch between them.

You interact with the game by giving commands to a character in the crew, making them perform various actions.
Currently available commands are:
- take <item>
- take all
- give <character> <item>
- wield <item>
- use <item>
- enter <path/door>
- force <door>
- attack <creature>
- attack
- wait
- rest
- launch ship
- status
- control <character>
- trade
- recruit aftik
When trading at a store, there are the following commands:
- buy <item>
- buy <number> <items>
- sell <item>
- sell <number> <items>
- sell all <items>
- exit
- status

Notes:
- "rest" doesn't heal health, instead it waits until stamina (a poorly visible stat that helps with dodging attacks) has recovered for the crew.
- Use the mouse to drag the camera view in larger areas indicated by white arrows. You can also use the mouse to see the name of objects in view. You can't use the mouse to give commands yet (but that might be added in future versions!).
- Save files do not exist at the moment. The game is not saved when the application is closed.
