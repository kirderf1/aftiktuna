Hello! Here are some basic instructions to fill in spaces that the game can't do itself in its current form.

The goal of the game is to travel from planet to planet, collecting fuel cans to refuel the ship.

The game has a graphical view and a text-only view. You can press tab to switch between them.

You interact with the game by giving commands to a character in the crew, making them perform various actions.
Currently available commands are:
- take <item>
- take all
- give <character> <item>
- wield <item>
- use <item>
- enter <path/door>
- force <door>
- attack <creature>
- attack
- wait
- rest
- launch ship
- status
- control <character>
- trade
- recruit aftik
- talk to <character>
- tell <character> to wait
- tell <character> to follow
- open fortuna chest

When trading at a store, there are the following commands:
- buy <item>
- buy <number> <items>
- sell <item>
- sell <number> <items>
- sell all <items>
- exit
- status

Notes:
- "rest" doesn't heal health, instead it waits until stamina (a poorly visible stat that helps with dodging attacks) has recovered for the crew.
- Use the mouse to drag the camera view in larger areas indicated by white arrows.
- You can also use the mouse to see the name of objects in view.
- You can click game objects to get a list of command suggestions. Note that this does not cover all possible commands that you might want to do.
- The game saves automatically when closed, and loads automatically if a save file is present. To restart the game, you can remove the save file. It's possible to disable autosaving by passing in "--disable-autosave" as a flag when running the executable.
