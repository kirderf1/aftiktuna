# Aftiktuna

A game based on the webcomic and fictional game [\[Fortuna\]](https://cosmosdex.com/fortuna/p/0).

In its current form, this is a 1D exploration game where the goal is to obtain fuel for your ship in order to proceed from location to location.

The game does not yet have any public builds available for download, so you need to compile it yourself to try it out.

The java version of the game is currently the primary version. However a version in rust is being developed to explore alternative design patterns, and to compare rust as an alternative to java for this game.
