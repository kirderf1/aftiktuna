# Aftiktuna

A game based on the webcomic and fictional game [\[Fortuna\]](https://cosmosdex.com/fortuna/p/0).

In its current form, this is a 1D exploration game (with 2D graphics) where the goal is to obtain fuel for your ship in order to proceed from location to location in search of the Fortuna treasure.

The java version is no longer being developed in favor of the rust version, which has taken over the mantle as the superior version of this game.

This project exists for me to practice game design and build systems at my own pace. At this moment, it exists almost exclusively for myself, and remains in an experimental state.

For this reason, outside contributions might not get accepted. But if you're nonetheless interested in contributing, feel free to get in touch with me.
